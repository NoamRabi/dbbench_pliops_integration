First check the number of open files the system is support by using "ulimit -n" and check if the number is smaller then 1048576.

1.. Edit the file /etc/security/limits.conf
    add the following lines at the bottom of the file:
  	* soft     nproc          1048576
	* hard     nproc          1048576
	* soft     nofile         1048576
	* hard     nofile         1048576
	root soft     nproc          1048576
	root hard     nproc          1048576
	root soft     nofile         1048576
	root hard     nofile         1048576   
2. Run the command "sudo sh -c 'echo 1048576 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max'"
