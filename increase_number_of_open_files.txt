# In order to enable rocksdb over large capacity we need to enlarge the number of open files in parallel that the OS support,
# please follow the following commands


First check the ncurrent umber of open files the system is support by using "ulimit -n" and check the number is 1048576 or above
if not:

1. Edit the file /etc/security/limits.conf
    add the following lines at the bottom of the file:
  	* soft     nproc          1048576
	* hard     nproc          1048576
	* soft     nofile         1048576
	* hard     nofile         1048576
	root soft     nproc          1048576
	root hard     nproc          1048576
	root soft     nofile         1048576
	root hard     nofile         1048576   
2. Run the command "sudo sh -c 'echo 1048576 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max'"
3. Edit the files /etc/systemd/user.conf and /etc/systemd/system.conf:
    change the value of DefaultLimitNOFILE to 1048576, and uncomment the line.
4. Ubuntu only:
    A. Edit the file /etc/sysctl.conf 
       change the value of fs.file-max to 1048576
    B. Edit the following file /etc/pam.d/common-session
       add the following line - "session required pam_limits.so"

5. Reboot the server in order that the configuration changes will take affect.
6. After reboot check the configuration has changed with "ulimit -n" again.
