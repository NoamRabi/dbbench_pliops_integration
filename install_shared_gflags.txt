If during cmake run, you encounter errors related to gflags linkage, please track the following instructions:

1. Clone gflags from github - git clone https://github.com/gflags/gflags.git
2. Enter gflags library
3. Edit CmakeLists.txt file, enable shared libraries (OFF->ON):

   	gflags_define (BOOL BUILD_SHARED_LIBS          "Request build of shared libraries."                                       ON  ON)
      gflags_define (BOOL BUILD_STATIC_LIBS          "Request build of static libraries (default if BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is OFF)." ON  ON)

5. Clean cmake cache - rm CmakeCache.txt
6. Create build directory - mkdir build
7. Enter build directoy - cd build
8. Run cmake for gflags - cmake ..
9. Run make for gflags - make -j
10. Run make install - sudo make install

If all stages were completed succesfully please return to the main steps
