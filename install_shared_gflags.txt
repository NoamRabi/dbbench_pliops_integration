If during cmake run, you encounter errors related to gflags linkage, please track the following instructions:

1. clone gflags from github - git clone https://github.com/gflags/gflags.git
2. Edit CmakeLists.txt file, enable shared libraries:

   	gflags_define (BOOL BUILD_SHARED_LIBS          "Request build of shared libraries."                                       ON  ON)
        gflags_define (BOOL BUILD_STATIC_LIBS          "Request build of static libraries (default if BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is OFF)." ON  ON)

3. clean cmake cache - rm CmakeCache.txt
4. run cmake for gflags - cmake .
5. run make for gflags - make -j
6. run make install - sudo make install

If all was completed succesfully please return to the main steps
